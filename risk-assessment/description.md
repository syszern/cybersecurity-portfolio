# Risk Assessment for a Fictional Commercial Bank

**Background:** A new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. The team is creating a **risk register** to focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

**Objective:** Perform a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that threaten business operations and prioritize resources based on the risk scores assigned to each vulnerability.

**Tasks:**

1. **Evaluate Risks:**
    - Review the set of risks recorded in the risk register.
    - Determine the likelihood of each risk occurring.
    - Assess the potential impact of each risk on the bank.
      
2. **Calculate Risk Scores:**
    - Assign a score to each risk based on its likelihood and severity.
    - Compare the scores across all risks to prioritize attention for each risk.

**Process:**

1. **Create a Risk Register:** Maintain a central record of potential risks to the organization's assets, information systems, and data.

2. **Assess Likelihood and Impact:** Evaluate how likely each risk is to occur and how severely it may impact the bank.

3. **Prioritize Risks:** Use the risk scores to determine how to allocate resources and focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

**Outcome:** Improve the bank's security posture by identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks, allowing the cybersecurity team to effectively allocate resources and mitigate potential threats.
