## Threat Modeling Practice
### PASTA Threat Model for Sneaker Company App
**Background:** A company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors is preparing to launch a mobile app that facilitates buying and selling shoes. The security team, including the cybersecurity analyst, needs to determine if the new app is safe to launch.

**Objective:** Perform a threat model of the application using the Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.

**Tasks:**
1. **Understand Business Objectives:**  Identify the business goals and objectives for the new sneaker company app.

2. **Define the Technical Scope:** Outline the app's architecture, components, and data flow.

3. **Analyze the Threat Landscape:** Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the app.

4. **Evaluate Security Requirements:** Determine the security requirements needed to protect the app from identified threats.

5. **Analyze Attack Vectors:** Simulate possible attack scenarios and assess the impact on the app.

6. **Assess Risk:** Evaluate the likelihood and impact of potential attacks and prioritize mitigation strategies.

7. **Plan Security Controls:** Recommend security controls and measures to protect the app and ensure it meets security requirements.

**Outcome:** Ensure the new sneaker company app is secure by identifying and mitigating potential threats through the PASTA framework, ultimately supporting a safe and successful launch.
