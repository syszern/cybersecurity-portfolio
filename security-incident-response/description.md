## NIST CSF for Security Incident Response
### Incident Report and Network Security Plan for Multimedia Company
**Background:** A cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses recently encountered a DDoS attack. The attack compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved. During the attack, the organizationâ€™s network services stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets, preventing normal internal network traffic from accessing resources.

**Objective:**
  - Analyze the network incident using the National Institute of Standards and   Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).
  - Create an incident report detailing the DDoS attack and the steps taken to resolve it.
  - Develop a plan to improve the company's network security and prevent future incidents.

**Tasks:**
1. **Analyze the Situation:** Review the DDoS attack and its impact on the network.
Investigate the security event and identify the vulnerability that allowed the attack.

2. **Create Incident Report:** Document the details of the DDoS attack, including the incoming flood of ICMP packets and the network's response. Record the actions taken by the incident management team to block ICMP packets, take non-critical services offline, and restore critical services.

3. **Develop Network Security Plan:** Implement new firewall rules to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.
Verify the source IP addresses on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets.
Deploy network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.
Use an IDS/IPS system to filter out ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.

4. **Follow NIST CSF Steps:**
    - **Identify:** Conduct regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential security gaps.
    - **Protect:** Implement policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats.
    - **Detect:** Improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detecting potential security incidents.
    - **Respond:** Contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process.
    - **Recover:** Restore affected systems to normal operation and recover systems data and/or assets affected by the incident.

**Outcome:** Enhance the company's network security by documenting the incident, implementing preventive measures, and following the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to protect against future attacks.
