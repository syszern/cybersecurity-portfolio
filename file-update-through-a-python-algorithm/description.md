## File Update through a Python Algorithm
### Access Control Update for Health Care Company

**Background:** A security professional at a health care company is responsible for regularly updating a file that identifies employees who can access restricted content based on their IP addresses. The company maintains an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork and a remove list for IP addresses that should be removed from the allow list.

**Objective:** Create an algorithm using Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list and remove those IP addresses from the allow list file.

**Tasks:**
- **Check for IP Addresses:** Create a Python algorithm to compare the allow list and the remove list.

- **Update Allow List:** Remove any IP addresses from the allow list that are identified on the remove list.

**Steps:**
1. **Read the Allow List and Remove List:** Load the allow list and remove list from their respective files.

2. **Compare IP Addresses:** Check each IP address in the allow list against the remove list.

3. **Remove Identified IP Addresses:** Remove any IP addresses found in the remove list from the allow list.

4. **Save the Updated Allow List:** Write the updated allow list back to the file.

**Outcome:** Ensure that the allow list for the restricted subnetwork is updated by removing any unauthorized IP addresses, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of the health care company's access controls.
